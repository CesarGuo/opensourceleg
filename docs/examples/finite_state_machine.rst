Finite State Machine 
------------------------------
The library ships with three example implementations of the same finite state machine. We provide one implementation in ``python``, one in ``C++`` and one in ``MATLAB``. Each of these scripts can be used as examples to follow when generating new controllers in these languages. 


.. To include a diagram here of the state mahcine that we're using.
